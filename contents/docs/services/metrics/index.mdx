title: Metrics on Andasy.io
---

The Andasy.io platform includes a fully-managed metrics solution to help you easily monitor your Andasy apps.
It includes the following components:

- Default metrics viewer is provided which is based on Prometheus at [metrics.andasy.io](https://metrics.andasy.io)
- Managed Prometheus-compatible time series storage
- Metrics automatically sent from every Andasy app you deploy

## Prometheus on Andasy.io

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a popular open source monitoring system used to store and query metrics efficiently,
with a stable [HTTP querying API](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/) compatible with a range of systems.

**Prometheus on Andasy.io** is a fully-managed service based on [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/).
It [supports](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#prometheus-querying-api-usage) most common Prometheus querying API endpoints:
- [`/api/v1/query`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#instant-queries)
- [`/api/v1/query_range`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#range-queries)
- [`/api/v1/series`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#finding-series-by-label-matchers)
- [`/api/v1/labels`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#getting-label-names)
- [`/api/v1/label/<label_name>/values`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#querying-label-values)
- [`/api/v1/status/tsdb`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/api/#tsdb-stats)
- [`/federate`](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/federation/)

Note that [remote read](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#remote_read) (`/api/v1/read`) and [remote storage integration](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/storage/#remote-storage-integrations)
are not supported.

### MetricsQL

Prometheus queries are typically based on the [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) query language.
Prometheus on Andasy.io queries use [PromQL](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/).


### Querying

Queries can be sent to the following endpoint:
```
https://metrics.andasy.io/
```

You'll need to authenticate with a  Access Token sent in the [standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6750.html) Bearer Token format (e.g., an HTTP request header `Authorization: <TOKEN>`), and you may only query series scoped to your organizations.

#### Manually

**Get an access token**

```bash
TOKEN=$(andasy auth token)
```

**Test it out!**

```bash
curl https://metrics.andasy.io/api/v1/query \
  --data-urlencode 'query=sum(increase(cpu_seconds_total)) by (app_name, org_id)' \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN"
```

### External or self-hosted Grafana

You can also configure your Prometheus endpoint with an existing Grafana installation like this:

1. [Add](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/add-a-data-source/) a [Prometheus data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/) (Settings -> Data Sources -> Add data source -> Prometheus)
2. Fill the form with the following:
- HTTP -> URL: `https://metrics.andasy.io`
- Custom HTTP Headers -> + Add Header:
   - Header: `Authorization`, Value: `Bearer <token>`

You're all set.

### Standard Labels

All published series include the following labels:

- `app_name`: App name
- `org_id`: Organization ID
- `machine_id`: Virtual machine ID.
