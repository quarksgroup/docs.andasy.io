description: Learn how to create and manage database in Andasy.
---

The `database` command allows you to provision database services within Andasy. Database services are database instances that run as separate applications on the platform. When you create a database service, Andasy provides:

- **Automatic setup** - Database software is installed and initially configured automatically
- **Persistent storage** - Data is stored on volumes that survive restarts
- **Private network access** - Databases are accessible only within your Andasy organization's private network
- **Connection credentials** - Initial credentials are automatically generated

<Note type="info" title="You Manage the Database">
Andasy handles the **initial setup and installation** of the database software, but **you are responsible for managing the database itself**. This includes backups, configuration, updates, user management, and all database operations. You manage PostgreSQL through SSH access or standard database tools.
</Note>

## Supported Database Engines

Currently, the following database engines are supported:

- **[PostgreSQL](/docs/services/databases/postgres)** — Fully-managed PostgreSQL database service

<Note type="info" title="More Databases Coming">
Additional database engines (MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, etc.) will be supported in future versions of Andasy.
</Note>
