# Volume Snapshots

A **snapshot** is a read-only copy of a volume's data at a specific point in time. Think of it as a photograph of your data that captures the exact state of your volume at the moment the snapshot was taken. Snapshots serve as backups, allowing you to restore your data to a previous state or recover from data loss.

Key characteristics of snapshots:

- **Point-in-time backup** - Captures volume state at a specific moment
- **Automatic creation** - Andasy automatically creates daily snapshots of your volumes
- **Retention period** - Snapshots are retained for a limited time (check current retention policy)
- **Restore capability** - You can restore volumes from snapshots if data is lost or corrupted
- **Downloadable** - Snapshots can be downloaded for external backup or migration

Snapshots are essential for data protection, especially for databases and applications storing critical data.

## When to Use Snapshots

Use snapshots for:

- **Backup and recovery** - Protect against data loss from accidental deletion or corruption
- **Point-in-time recovery** - Restore data to a specific moment before an issue occurred
- **Migration** - Download snapshots to migrate data to another system
- **Testing** - Create a copy of production data for testing without affecting production

Snapshots are automatically created, but you can also download them manually for additional backup copies.

## Listing Volume Snapshots

List all snapshots for a volume:

```bash
andasy volumes snapshots list <volumeId> -a <app-name>
```

Parameters:
- `<app-name>` - The name of the application that owns the volume (required if `andasy.hcl` is not present)
- `<volumeId>` - The ID of the volume (optional). If omitted, lists snapshots for all volumes in the application

This command shows:
- Snapshot creation timestamps
- Snapshot IDs (needed for downloading)
- Volume information

### Viewing Snapshots of Deleted Volumes

You can also retrieve snapshots of deleted volumes if you know the volume ID:

```bash
andasy volumes snapshots list <deleted-volume-id> -a <app-name>
```

This is useful for recovering data from volumes that were accidentally deleted. Make sure to save volume IDs before deletion.

## Downloading Snapshots

To download a snapshot, you first need to generate a download link:

```bash
andasy volumes snapshots link <snapshot-id> -a <app-name>
```

Parameters:
- `<snapshot-id>` - The ID of the snapshot you want to download (get this from `snapshots list`)
- `<app-name>` - The name of the application that owns the volume (required if `andasy.hcl` is not present)

This command generates a secure download link that:
- **Valid for 24 hours** - The link expires after one day for security
- **Keep confidential** - Don't share the link publicly as it provides access to your data
- **Direct download** - Use the link with `wget`, `curl`, or a browser to download the snapshot

### Downloading Snapshots of Deleted Volumes

You can also generate download links for snapshots of deleted volumes:

```bash
andasy volumes snapshots link <snapshot-id> -a <app-name>
```

Use the volume ID from before deletion. This allows you to recover data even after a volume has been deleted, as long as snapshots are still retained.

### Example: Downloading a Snapshot

```bash
# 1. List snapshots to get the snapshot ID
andasy volumes snapshots list -a my-app

# 2. Generate download link
andasy volumes snapshots link abc123-snapshot-id -a my-app

# 3. Download using the provided link
wget "https://download-link-from-command-output"
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular backups** - While Andasy creates automatic snapshots, consider downloading important snapshots for external backup
2. **Save volume IDs** - Keep a record of volume IDs before deletion to access snapshots later
3. **Test restores** - Periodically test restoring from snapshots to ensure your backup process works
4. **Secure download links** - Keep download links confidential and download promptly (they expire in 24 hours)
