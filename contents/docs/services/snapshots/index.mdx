The snapshot commands focus on managing snapshots of a volume. Snapshot is a copy of a volume at a certain point in time, usually taken daily and retained for a certain period of time.

## Listing volume snapshots

The following command lists volume's snapshots attached to a specific application. This also can retrieve the snapshots of a deleted volume in case its ID is known.

```bash
andasy volumes snapshots list <volumeId> -a <app-name>
```

Replace `<app-name>` with the name of the application that owns the volume. Required if `config.hcl` is not present.

Replace `<volumeId>` with the ID of the volume (optional).

```bash
andasy volumes snapshots link <volumeId> -a <app-name>

Replace `<app-name>` with the name of the application that owns the volume. Required if `config.hcl` is not present.

Replace `<volumeId>` with the ID of the volume (optional).
