**Andasy** is a modern cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that helps developers deploy and manage applications without touching infrastructure. Whether you're running a simple API or a complex web app, Andasy handles builds, deployments, networking, scaling, and observabilityâ€”so you donâ€™t have to.

## Why Andasy?

Andasy simplifies app deployment by letting you:

- **Zero DevOps Overhead:** No containers, Kubernetes, or YAML required.
- **Private Container Registry:** Your apps are automatically built and stored securely.
- **Run anything** â€” Works with any language or framework using a `Dockerfile`.
- **Get built-in CI/CD** â€” Apps are rebuilt and redeployed on code changes.
- **Custom Domains & SSL:** Easily connect your own domains with automatic SSL.

## Quickstart

Ready to launch your app on Andasy? First, install the **Andasy CLI**.

### 1. Install the CLI

The **Andasy CLI** is your main interface for deploying and managing applications. To install it:

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
curl -fsSL https://andasy.io/install.sh | bash
```

#### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr -useb https://andasy.io/install.ps1 | iex
```

After installation, verify itâ€™s working:

```bash
andasy version
```

> ðŸ’¡ If you're on macOS or Linux, you may need to restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` to activate the CLI.

### 2. Create an Account

If you havenâ€™t already, [sign up for a free Andasy account](https://andasy.io/auth/register).

Once registered, log in via the CLI:

```bash
andasy auth login
```

### 3. Deploy Your First App

You can deploy any app that includes a `Dockerfile`. If you donâ€™t have one, Andasy will generate it for you.

#### Step 1: Set Up the Project

Run this inside your project directory:

```bash
andasy setup
```

This:
- Detects your stack and creates a `Dockerfile` (if missing)
- Registers your app on Andasy
- Generates a `andasy.hcl` file to define your deployment

> ðŸ’¡ Check that the `andasy.hcl` has the right port and settings for your app.

#### Step 2: Deploy

To build and deploy your app, run:

```bash
andasy deploy
```

Andasy will:
- Package your code
- Build it remotely
- Push the image to your private registry
- Deploy the container and assign a URL

Want to build locally?

```bash
andasy build --mode local
andasy deploy --image-label <your-local-image-url>
```

#### Step 3: Visit Your App

After deploying, the CLI will display your app's live URL, usually:

```
https://<your-app-name>.andasy.dev
```

## What's Next?

Now that you're live, you can:
- [**SSH into your app**](/docs/services/ssh) for debugging
- Use [**andasy logs**](/docs/services/logs) to view real-time output
- Add [**environment variables**](/docs/reference/secrets), secrets, or scale services
