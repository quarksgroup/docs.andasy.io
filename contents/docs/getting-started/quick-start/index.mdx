---

This guide will help you get started with Andasy and deploy your first application. Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- An Andasy account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free [here](https://andasy.io/auth/register).
- The Andasy CLI installed on your local machine. Check out the [installation guide](/docs/getting-started/installation) for more information.
- A basic understanding of Docker and how to create a `Dockerfile` for your application.

## Deploying Your First Application

To deploy your first application on Andasy, you need to first log in to your Andasy account using the following command:

```bash
andasy auth login
```

### Step 1: Create a New Project

In order to deploy an application on Andasy, you need to create a new project. A project must contain the source code of your application and a `Dockerfile` that specifies how to build the application.

To initialize andasy in your project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
andasy setup
```

This will create an application on andasy and try to detect the type of application you are trying to deploy and generate a Dockerfile for you.

After the project is created, it will write a `config.hcl` file in your project directory with the necessary information for your application deployment. Double-check the configuration to ensure it is correct with the right port for your application.

### Step 2: Deploy Your Application

Once you have created your project, you can deploy it to Andasy by running the following command:

```bash
andasy deploy
```

This command will package your application, send it to a remote builder, and deploy it to the Andasy platform.

If you want to build your application locally, you can use the following command:

```bash
andasy build --mode local
```

This will build your application image locally and push it to our registry.

You can deploy your application by just providing the application docker image URL:

```bash
andasy deploy --image-label <image-url>
```

### Step 3: Access Your Application

After your application has been deployed, you can access it by visiting the URL displayed in the output of the `andasy deploy` command or go to `https://<app_name>.andasy.dev`.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed your first application on Andasy.

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed your first application on Andasy, you can explore the various features and capabilities of the platform. Here are some next steps you can take:

- Learn how you can ssh into your application container.
- Explore the various features of the Andasy platform, such as custom domains, SSL certificates, and more.
