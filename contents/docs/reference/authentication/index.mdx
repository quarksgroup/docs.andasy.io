description: Learn how to authenticate with Andasy and manage your account.
---

To use the Andasy CLI and deploy applications to the Andasy platform, you need to authenticate with your Andasy account. **Authentication** is the process of proving your identity to Andasy. Once authenticated, you can:

- Deploy and manage applications
- Access your organization's resources
- View logs, metrics, and other application data
- Manage team members and permissions
- Generate access tokens for API access

Your authentication session persists until you explicitly log out or the session expires. You only need to authenticate once per machine unless you log out.

## Logging In

To log in to your Andasy account, run:

```bash
andasy auth login
```

This command opens a browser window where you can enter your Andasy credentials. Once you successfully log in, you'll be able to use the Andasy CLI to deploy and manage applications.

### Interactive Mode (Terminal-Based)

If you prefer not to use a browser, use interactive mode:

```bash
andasy auth login --interactive
```

This prompts you to enter your email and password directly in the terminal. Useful for:
- Remote servers without browser access
- Automated scripts (though tokens are preferred for automation)
- Terminal-only environments

### Direct Credentials (Not Recommended)

You can pass credentials directly via flags, but this is **not recommended** for security reasons:

```bash
andasy auth login --email <email> --password <password>
```

**Security concerns:**
- Passwords may appear in command history
- Credentials visible in process lists
- Risk of exposure in shared environments

Use browser or interactive mode instead, or use access tokens for automation (see below).

## Getting Access Tokens

For automation, CI/CD pipelines, or API access, use access tokens instead of password authentication:

```bash
andasy auth token
```

This generates an access token that you can use for:
- API requests (include as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header)
- CI/CD pipelines (store as a secret)
- External tooling integration

Tokens are more secure than passwords for automated use cases.

## Logging Out

To log out of your Andasy account:

```bash
andasy auth logout
```

This invalidates your current session and requires you to log in again to use the CLI. Useful when:
- Switching between accounts
- Using a shared machine
- Ending a work session

## Checking Authentication Status

Verify if you're currently authenticated:

```bash
andasy auth status
```

This shows:
- Whether you're logged in
- Your account email
- Current organization (if set)
- Session expiration information
