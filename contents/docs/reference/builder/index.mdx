description: Learn how to manage organization builder in Andasy.
---

Each organization on andasy platform has a dedicated builder that is used to build the application image. A builder is a normal app provisioned automatically for each organization to be used during
`andasy deploy`. It is used if the user is not using the local Docker to create their image.

## Info of the builder

The following command gets an organization builder information.

```bash
 andasy orgs builder info -o <org_slug>
```
Replace `<org_slug>` with the organization slug. `-o <org_slug>` is optional.

The output will look like this:
```
Builder information
  App_ID  = 40a40cdb-55c8-4364-bae1-f038833133ce
  Name    = nights-lecturer-market
  URL     = https://nights-lecturer-market.andasy.dev/
  State   = running
  Created = 2025-07-07 09:38:21
  Updated = 2025-07-07 09:38:21
```
`Name` is the name of the app of this builder. So builder can be managed like all other apps by using this name.

## Pinging the builder

The following command pings an organization builder for health checks. This helps to check if your builder is up and running.

```bash
andasy orgs builder ping -o <org_slug>
```
Replace `<org_slug>` with the organization slug. `-o <org_slug>` is optional.

## Restarting the builder

The following command restarts an organization builder. Sometimes the provisioned builder can be full on disk due to caches or you may want to get
the latest update of the our builder. This command regenerate a fresh builder by getting the latest version and deleting all caches.

```bash
andasy orgs builder restart -o <org_slug>
```
Replace `<org_slug>` with the organization slug. `-o <org_slug>` is optional.

## Deleting the builder

The following command delete an organization builder. Once deleted, builder will be
recreated automatically during app deploy, unless local Docker is being used by all members of the organization.

```bash
andasy orgs builder delete -o <org_slug>
```
Replace `<org_slug>` with the organization slug. `-o <org_slug>` is optional.
