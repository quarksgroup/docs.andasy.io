description: Learn how to manage organization builder in Andasy.
---

Each organization on the Andasy platform has a dedicated **builder** that is used to build container images for your applications. A **builder** is an application automatically provisioned for each organization that:

- **Builds container images** - Compiles your code and creates Docker images from your Dockerfile
- **Runs during remote deployments** - Used when you deploy with `andasy deploy` (remote mode, the default)
- **Shared across organization** - All members of an organization use the same builder
- **Managed automatically** - Created and maintained by Andasy, but you can manage it if needed

When you run `andasy deploy` in **remote mode** (the default), your code is sent to the builder, which builds the container image and pushes it to Andasy's registry. If you use **local mode** (`-m local`), the builder is not used, you build the image on your machine.

The builder is essentially a build server that runs Docker and has access to all the tools needed to build your applications. You typically don't need to interact with it directly, but you can manage it for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes.

## Getting Builder Information

View information about your organization's builder:

```bash
andasy orgs builder info -o <org_slug>
```

Replace `<org_slug>` with your organization slug. The `-o` flag is optional if you're working with your default organization.

The output shows:
- **App_ID** - Unique identifier for the builder application
- **Name** - The application name of the builder (you can use this to manage it like any other app)
- **URL** - The builder's public URL (if accessible)
- **State** - Current state (e.g., `running`, `stopped`)
- **Created/Updated** - Timestamps for creation and last update

Since the builder is a regular application, you can manage it using standard app commands with the builder's name (e.g., `andasy apps restart -a <builder-name>`).

## Checking Builder Health

Ping the builder to verify it's running and responsive:

```bash
andasy orgs builder ping -o <org_slug>
```

Replace `<org_slug>` with your organization slug. The `-o` flag is optional if you're working with your default organization.

This command checks if the builder is up and running. Use this if deployments are failing and you suspect builder issues.

## Restarting the Builder

Restart the builder to refresh it:

```bash
andasy orgs builder restart -o <org_slug>
```

Replace `<org_slug>` with your organization slug. The `-o` flag is optional if you're working with your default organization.

**When to restart the builder:**
- **Disk space issues** - If the builder's disk is full due to accumulated build caches
- **Get latest updates** - To get the latest builder image with updated tools and dependencies
- **Troubleshooting** - If builds are failing and you've ruled out other causes

Restarting regenerates a fresh builder instance with the latest version and clears all caches, which can resolve build issues related to stale caches or outdated builder images.

## Deleting the Builder

Delete the builder (it will be recreated automatically when needed):

```bash
andasy orgs builder delete -o <org_slug>
```

Replace `<org_slug>` with your organization slug. The `-o` flag is optional if you're working with your default organization.

**What happens when you delete:**
- The builder application is removed
- It will be **automatically recreated** the next time someone in your organization runs `andasy deploy` (in remote mode)
- If all organization members use local Docker builds (`-m local`), the builder won't be recreated until someone uses remote mode

Deleting and recreating the builder can help resolve persistent issues, as it starts with a completely fresh state.
