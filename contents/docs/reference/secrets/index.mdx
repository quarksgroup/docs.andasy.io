description: Learn how to manage sensitive secrets for your app.

## Overview

The `secret` commands in Andasy CLI are designed to manage sensitive environment variables and secrets for applications deployed on the Andasy platform. **Secrets** are sensitive configuration values (like API keys, database passwords, or tokens) that your application needs at runtime but shouldn't be stored in your code or configuration files.

Secrets are encrypted environment variables that are:

- **Stored securely** - Encrypted at rest and transmitted securely
- **Injected at runtime** - Made available to your application as environment variables
- **Not in code** - Kept separate from your application code and configuration files
- **Access-controlled** - Only accessible to applications and users with proper permissions

Common examples of secrets include:
- Database connection strings and passwords
- API keys for third-party services
- OAuth client secrets
- Encryption keys
- Service account credentials

Using secrets instead of hardcoding sensitive values in your `andasy.hcl` file keeps your credentials secure and allows you to use different values for different environments (development, staging, production).

## Command Syntax

```bash
andasy secret [command]
```

### Aliases

The `secret` command can be invoked using any of the following aliases:
- `secret`
- `env`
- `secrets`
- `sec`

## Available Commands

### Secret List

The `list` command displays all secrets stored for a specified application.

#### Usage

```bash
andasy secret list -a <app-name> [flags]
```

#### Aliases
- `list`
- `ls`

#### Flags

| Flag | Short Form | Description | Required |
|------|------------|-------------|----------|
| `--app` | `-a` | The target Andasy application name | No |
| `--config` | `-c` | Path to application configuration file | No |
| `--help` | `-h` | Display help information for the list command | No |
| `--json` | `-j` | Output results in JSON format | No |

#### Example

```bash
# List all secrets for an app
andasy secret list
```

### Secret Set

The `set` command creates or updates secrets for a specified application.

#### Usage

```bash
andasy secret set [flags] NAME=VALUE NAME=VALUE... -a <app-name>
```

#### Flags

| Flag | Short Form | Description | Required |
|------|------------|-------------|----------|
| `--app` | `-a` | The target Andasy application name | No |
| `--config` | `-c` | Path to application configuration file | No |
| `--help` | `-h` | Display help information for the set command | No |
| `--json` | `-j` | Output results in JSON format | No |

#### Examples

```bash
# Set a single secret for an app
andasy secret set API_KEY=abc123xyz

# Set multiple secrets at once
andasy secret set DB_USER=admin DB_PASSWORD=secure123 API_KEY=xyz987abc

# Set secrets using a specific config file
andasy secret set STRIPE_KEY=sk_test_123456 -a my-web-api -c ./config/andasy.hcl
```

## Global Flags

The following flags are available across all `andasy secret` commands:

| Flag | Short Form | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Enable verbose output for detailed logging |
| `--json` | `-j` | Output results in JSON format |

## Security Best Practices

When working with the `andasy secret` commands, consider these security recommendations:

1. **Never store secrets in version control**: Use the `andasy secret` commands instead of hardcoding secrets in your `andasy.hcl` files.

2. **Limit access to secret management**: Only authorized team members should have permission to view or modify secrets.

3. **Rotate secrets regularly**: Update sensitive credentials periodically using the `set` command.

4. **Use different secrets across environments**: Maintain separate secrets for development, staging, and production environments.

## How Secrets Work

Secrets are stored separately from your application configuration and are automatically injected into your application's environment at runtime. Your application accesses them just like regular environment variables.

### Setting Secrets

Secrets are set using the CLI and stored securely on Andasy's platform:

```bash
andasy secret set API_KEY=abc123xyz -a my-app
```

### Using Secrets in Your Application

Secrets are automatically available as environment variables in your application. You don't need to reference them in `andasy.hcl`:

```hcl
app_name = "my-web-api"

app {
  env = {
    # Only include non-sensitive environment variables here
    NODE_ENV = "production"
    LOG_LEVEL = "info"
  }
  
  # Secrets are automatically injected - no need to reference them here
}
```

In your application code, access secrets like any environment variable:

```javascript
// Node.js example
const apiKey = process.env.API_KEY;
```

```python
# Python example
import os
api_key = os.environ.get('API_KEY')
```

The secrets set using the CLI are automatically injected into your application's environment at runtime, so your application code doesn't need any special handling. Just read environment variables as usual.

## Common Use Cases

### CI/CD Integration

In automated deployment pipelines, you can use the `andasy secret set` command to dynamically update secrets:

```bash
# In a CI/CD pipeline script
andasy secret set VERSION=$BUILD_VERSION DEPLOY_TIME=$(date) -a my-web-api
```

### Database Credentials Management

Store database connection details securely:

```bash
andasy secret set \
  DB_HOST=postgres.example.com \
  DB_PORT=5432 \
  DB_USER=app_user \
  DB_PASSWORD=highly_secure_password \
  -a my-web-api
```

### API Keys Rotation

When rotating API keys, you can easily update them:

```bash
# Update an API key
andasy secret set API_KEY=new_key_value -a my-web-api
```

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Command fails with "App not found" | Verify the app name with `andasy apps list` |
| Unable to set secrets | Ensure you have proper permissions for the application |
| Secrets not available in app | Check that the app is redeployed after setting new secrets |
