Machines are the microVMs that run your applications on the Andasy platform. Your application code is packaged into a container image and deployed to a machine, where it is run in a secure and isolated environment. An application can have multiple machines associated with it, allowing you to scale your application horizontally.

You can list machines associated with an application in the Andasy CLI by running the following command:

```bash
andasy machines list -a <app-name>
```

This command will display a list of machines associated with the specified application, along with their state and timestamps. You can use this information to monitor the health and performance of your application.
