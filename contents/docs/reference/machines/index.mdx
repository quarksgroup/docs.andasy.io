description: Learn how to create and manage machines in Andasy.
---

Machines are the microVMs that run your applications on the Andasy platform. Your application code is packaged into a container image and deployed to a machine, where it is run in a secure and isolated environment. An application can have multiple machines associated with it, allowing you to scale your application horizontally.

## Listing machines

You can list machines associated with an application in the Andasy CLI by running the following command:

```bash
andasy machines list -a <app-name>
```

This command will display a list of machines associated with the specified application, along with their state and timestamps. You can use this information to monitor the health and performance of your application.

## Stopping machine

This command will stop a particular machine of a running application.

```bash
andasy machines stop <machine-id> -a <app-name>
```

`<machine-id>` is optional. `-a <app-name>` is optional if `config.hcl` is present.

## Resuming machine

This command will resume a particular machine of provided app service.

```bash
andasy machines resume <machine-id> -a <app-name>
```

`<machine-id>` is optional. `-a <app-name>` is optional if `config.hcl` is present.

## Deleting machine

This command will delete a particular machine of a provided app service.

```bash
andasy machines delete <machine-id> -a <app-name>
```

`<machine-id>` is optional. `-a <app-name>` is optional if `config.hcl` is present.

## View status of a machine

This command reports the live status of an application ([ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#entrypoint) or [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd)) running inside the machine.
This is should not be regarded as server health checks; Application ([ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#entrypoint) or [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#cmd)) may be running while the server is still starting up or failed to start;
In this case this command will report running state.

```bash
andasy machines status <machine-id> -a <app-name>
```

`<machine-id>` is optional. `-a <app-name>` is optional if `config.hcl` is present in current directory.
