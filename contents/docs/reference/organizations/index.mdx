An **organization** in Andasy is a logical grouping that contains:

- **Users** - Team members who have access to the organization
- **Applications** - All applications created within the organization
- **Resources** - Volumes, databases, and other resources associated with the organization
- **Access control** - Permissions and roles for team members

Organizations enable:
- **Team collaboration** - Multiple users can work together on shared applications
- **Project separation** - Keep different projects or environments isolated
- **Access management** - Control who can access which applications and resources
- **Billing organization** - Group resources for billing and cost management

By default, when you create an account on Andasy, you are automatically added to a **personal organization** with your account name. You can create additional organizations to group users and applications based on your needs (e.g., separate organizations for different projects, clients, or teams).

## Creating an Organization

### Using the Andasy CLI

To create an organization using the Andasy CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
andasy orgs create
```

This command will prompt you to enter the email address that you want to associate with the organization and the name of the organization. Once you have entered this information, the organization will be created, and you will be added as the owner.

The organization will be created, and you will be added as the owner.

## Managing an Organization

To add users to an organization, you need to be the owner of the organization. You can add users to an organization using the Andasy Dashboard.

To add a user to an organization using the Andasy Dashboard, follow these steps:

2. Click on the "Team" tab.
