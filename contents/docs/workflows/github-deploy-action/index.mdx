[Andasy-action](https://github.com/quarksgroup/andasy-action) is a GitHub Action designed to deploy your GitHub repository to the [andasy.io](https://andasy.io/) platform. This action automates the deployment process using the `andasy-cli`.

## Features

* **Automated Deployment** : Deploy your project to `andasy.io` with ease.
* **Secure Authentication** : Use `ANDASY_ACCESS_TOKEN` for secure access.
* **Customizable Workflows** : Easily integrate with your existing CI/CD workflows.

## Prerequisites

### Obtain Access Token

1. Run the following command on your local machine with authenticated account on Andasy and obtain your token:
   ```
   andasy auth token
   ```
2. Copy the generated token value.

### Set Up Repository Secrets

Add the copied token value to your GitHub repository secrets:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions`.
3. Click `New repository secret`.
4. Add a new secret with the name `ANDASY_ACCESS_TOKEN` and paste the token as it's value or (`Secret *` field).

## Usage

To use the `andasy-action`, you'll need to create or update your workflow file (usually located at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`).
