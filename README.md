## Quick Start

Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>

```bash
# To support React 19, package maintainers will need to test and update their packages to include React 19 as a peer dependency. This is already in progress.
bun install --force
```

Start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
bun dev
# or
npm run dev
# or
